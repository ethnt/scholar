# Scholar

Scholar is learning management made simple.

## Objectives

* **Enable communication between students and faculty** &mdash; Getting in touch with other people in your course (including your professor) shouldn't be difficult.
* **Simple access to resources** &mdash; Don't know what you need for that essay? No problem.
* **Honest pricing** &mdash; Simple, honest pricing for both small and large schools.
* **Keep all resources self-contained** &mdash; Student and course information needs to be secure. Most universities require this information to stay on-campus, and not be hosted by third-parties.
* **Simple distribution** &mdash; Distribute the application with Docker, Vagrant, or some other VM-based solution. It should be easy to set up as well.
* **Fast on low-grade hardware** &mdash; Should be able to work reliably on computers as underpowered as a Raspberry Pi.
* **User-friendly** &mdash; That 2000-year-old professor deep in the bowels of the philosophy department should have no trouble using it.
* **Maximum security and encryption** &mdash; Encrypt everything in the database; administrators should not be able to see information that does not pertain to running the service. As NSA-, FBI-, and subpoena-proof as possible. That includes SSL.
* **No maintenance** &mdash; Some college networking administrators are competent. Others are not. They shouldn't need to work hard, and it shouldn't be easy to screw up everything.
